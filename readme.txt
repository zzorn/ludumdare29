Crushing Depth
==============

Ludumdare29 entry by zzorn

This is a submarine fight simulator.  Your objective is to destroy the enemy submarines before they destroy you.

The actual gameplay is pretty unfinished, I ended up putting most time into creating the physics and simulation again.



Requirements
============

Make sure you have Java installed.


Starting
========

Extract the zip file, then:

On Linux
--------

Run the start.sh script, for example by opening the terminal in the directory you unpacked the game in and typing
./start.sh
and enter.


On Windows
----------

Double-click on start.bat



Usage
=====

Press space to fire a torpedoe.
There is a reload time of a few seconds.

Press Enter to switch views.

Surface diesel engines / Underwater electric motor:
Increase speed with W, decrease it with S.

Rudder:
Turn left with A, right with D.

Dive fin:
Dive down with F, up with R.

Ballast tank:
Pump water into the tank with Down Array (makes submarine heavier) , and pump water out with Up Arrow (makes submarine lighter).

Recharge batteries with diesel engines (works only at surface):
Turn on with C, off with X.
(Not needed unless you want to play a _really_ long time).

The red hand on each gauge indicates the player selected level, while the white hand indicates the actual level.


Issues
======

There is no death screen - if you get destroyed, the camera and UI just stays floating at the point where you died.

There is no sound.
